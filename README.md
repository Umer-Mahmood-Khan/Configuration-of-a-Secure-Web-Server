## Introduction
Today, we embark on a journey to enhance the security of online platforms by configuring a web server with robust defenses against potential threats. Our project revolves around deploying a simple Flask app on a free online server, highlighting vulnerabilities in the initial setup, and implementing best practices to fortify our defenses.

<br>This architecture diagram shows a computer system with a network connection. The firewall protects the system, while the reverse proxy acts as an intermediary for client requests and server responses. Applications utilize hardware resources and network connection to perform tasks, and the database stores and manages data.
## Not Secure

<br>This diagram shows a network with several open ports and potential security vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords. It is important to ensure that networks are properly secured, including by limiting open ports and using strong, unique passwords.
## Secure

<br>This secure network diagram prioritizes security at every level, from the DNS server to the individual devices and applications on the network. By implementing best practices such as HTTPS, firewalls, limited ports, and strong passwords, network administrators can help ensure that their networks are secure and protected against potential threats.
